##The goals for this challenge are for you to:

1. Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with *PCA* and clustering using *K-means*.
2. Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from **sklearn**.
3. Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
4. Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
